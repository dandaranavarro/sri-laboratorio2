its a mystery in view that the
england no natural predators there

ferocity of the attack would suggest

satans power to transform
men in irons

 
but no doubt the ancient pagans

 
no prophets

 
daniel warned him not to nebuchadnezzar

 
but orgoliosul king
did not listened to daniel,

 
and as the bible tells us that he was
converted into a wolf and exiled people

 
the beast has come between us

 
but lord
and i will defend believers

 
with his right hand,
will crush the demon apples and av

 
i say, the enemy plan
is one and iret

 
turning them on the blestemai
in irons

 
wants to throw us into hell,
to transform us into animals

 
try to convince us,

 
that we forget that fcui
the image of the almighty himself i

 
samson

 
why tolerate our lord
this mockery

 
pride only open path of destruction

 
spirit seme before fall 

 
i say that is happening
because we have sinned in front of his

 
because of our iniquities
were echoed in heaven

 
and demand revenge

 
a bitter, please

 
 madam kirk

the most important 300

 
inhabitants of blackmoor
living within a radius of 500 meters

 
of this tavern,

 
im going to spend the evening here

to nsnto and mental improvement

 
and we all know that mr talbot
suffered

 
personal experiences
trauma

 
he witnessed the selfharm
his mother,

 
and minds of young,
unable to accept reality,

 
created a really fantastic

 
that his father is to blame

 
that his father is, literally,
a monster
